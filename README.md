# stm32 sine wave generator with multiple sets of data

Most of my code is located in main.c/main.h and functions.c/function.h, other stuff is mostly system code and is generated by stm32cubemx.

for the oled lcd i used [this library](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306 "oled lcd library")

[Data transmission script](https://github.com/uki44/sine-generator-hid-sender "Program used for data transmission") which is used to send data to the device
